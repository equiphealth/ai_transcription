Patient stated they completed the SMT for two out of the seven days since last session, stating they “gave up trying to write anything down” after a binge/purge episode on Wednesday. Therapist and patient processed patient’s feelings of shame and then walked through what happened before and after the binge. Identified that patient’s restricted food intake earlier in the day increased vulnerability to binge later on. Reviewed pros/cons of engaging in regular eating. Patient reported feeling ambivalent about regular eating. Patient committed to trying to record meals/snacks on SMT for three days over the upcoming week before next session. Therapist will follow up and send patient details about adult support group.'''
