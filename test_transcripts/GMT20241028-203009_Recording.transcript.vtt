1
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.740
Hmm.

2
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.020
Monifa McCarther: Hmm

3
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.590
Monifa McCarther: hmm weird.

4
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.150
Monifa McCarther: So.

5
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.400
Kristy Ouellette: Hi! I'm sorry. I just thought you were calling, and I went. Oh, no.

6
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.370
Kristy Ouellette: I totally forgot. But welcome back. I'm really glad that

7
00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:02.800
Kristy Ouellette: you're here.

8
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.519
Kristy Ouellette: and and I hope everything is safe as safe as can be in the situation.

9
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.730
Monifa McCarther: It's as safe as it can be.

10
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.630
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah.

11
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.310
Monifa McCarther: No.

12
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.270
Monifa McCarther: So everything. Okay, it's good.

13
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.460
Kristy Ouellette: Going. It always goes.

14
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.340
Kristy Ouellette: I don't know

15
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.019
Kristy Ouellette: we're we're in a better place than we were last year. That's for sure. That's for sure.

16
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.190
Monifa McCarther: I'll take that.

17
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.330
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah, yeah.

18
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:35.870
Monifa McCarther: Alright. Catch me up! It's been probably over a month, I would say.

19
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:52.489
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah, so so I guess, like a lot, a lot has happened. We had the second Ppt and I I think I at that. I think I put a little blurb. I can't. I should have checked what I wrote last.

20
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:58.600
Kristy Ouellette: but she had the second ppt, and she officially was labeled as dyslexic.

21
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.187
Kristy Ouellette: So that's a big deal, because

22
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.000
Kristy Ouellette: maybe

23
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:17.509
Kristy Ouellette: it helps explain why she hit such a hard wall last year, you know, frustrated, not being listened to. And and who knows how long she

24
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:24.829
Kristy Ouellette: had feelings and struggled through school, trying to do everything everyone else was doing. But like. Clearly, there's

25
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:36.560
Kristy Ouellette: there was different things going on so with the with the in the classroom. So I think, you know, and she's such a hard worker. So it's no surprise that she was so hard on herself.

26
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.150
Kristy Ouellette: So

27
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.209
Kristy Ouellette: so so I think that's gonna open up a lot of doors. And I think, too.

28
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:56.514
Kristy Ouellette: And I've talked to her a little bit about this. And I said, You know you, you're going to have to realize, like, accept, that things are going to be different now, like things are gonna be different, because

29
00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.750
Kristy Ouellette: everyone is aware of

30
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.460
Kristy Ouellette: you learning differently.

31
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.090
Kristy Ouellette: and there is more support for her.

32
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.989
Kristy Ouellette: And there is like a you know, a team working with her.

33
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.711
Kristy Ouellette: Make sure that she's understanding what she needs to.

34
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.209
Kristy Ouellette: and like you like to struggle for

35
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.879
Kristy Ouellette: all of your school career. And then all of a sudden, you you have to change

36
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.399
Kristy Ouellette: like it's it's gonna be a it's gonna be a mindset shift for her.

37
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:35.750
Kristy Ouellette: you know, and and and one of the things that we also talk about, too, is not to take advantage of any of the extra

38
00:10:36.483 --> 00:10:39.500
Kristy Ouellette: privileges and support services. And

39
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:45.050
Kristy Ouellette: you know the special Ed director noticed that she does need to get up and take a break and walk around. And

40
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.149
Kristy Ouellette: you know, last year, when things were really hard. That was one of the things she did. She would like to get up and walk outside.

41
00:10:52.396 --> 00:10:53.163
Kristy Ouellette: So

42
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.800
Kristy Ouellette: so just just talking to her about everything that's going on, and kind of like

43
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.710
Kristy Ouellette: being aware that

44
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.860
Kristy Ouellette: like

45
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.110
Kristy Ouellette: this

46
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:13.470
Kristy Ouellette: in the last like since the school started, and versus last year, when

47
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:20.799
Kristy Ouellette: there's an attitude or there's an aggression, or there's a big mood drop.

48
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.050
Kristy Ouellette: there's always more to it, and instead of getting discouraged or pushing harder back.

49
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.819
Kristy Ouellette: I try to change up my approach because I'd rather

50
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.740
Kristy Ouellette: get to the source because it's not.

51
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:40.520
Kristy Ouellette: I don't. It's it's like different parenting. I mean, that's why the family therapy is so important.

52
00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:44.030
Kristy Ouellette: Versus individual therapy

53
00:11:45.534 --> 00:11:50.509
Kristy Ouellette: and and so, you know, things things are going. Field hockey ended.

54
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.130
Kristy Ouellette: I think.

55
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.720
Monifa McCarther: She feeling about that.

56
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.850
Kristy Ouellette: She said that she was gonna play

57
00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.250
Kristy Ouellette: field hockey until she graduates high school.

58
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:07.830
Kristy Ouellette: So I think she's seeing the advantages of playing the sport. I think she liked being on the team and having a chance to

59
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.730
Kristy Ouellette: work with

60
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.699
Kristy Ouellette: different students that she normally wouldn't socialize with.

61
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:20.509
Kristy Ouellette: And getting to know different people. So after she made that comment the next day we had a game

62
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:38.230
Kristy Ouellette: away game and we hit traffic and and the people were driving. There was a huge accident right where we were getting off, and we were stuck. For half an hour the whole team was stuck on the highway, and people were driving nuts like on the shoulder, cutting each other off. And I was like.

63
00:12:39.178 --> 00:13:03.190
Kristy Ouellette: and we didn't even get to the game yet. So the game started an hour late. And then these kids that are like some of them are 12 or 11, even their 6, th 7, th and 8th grade. The other team is cursing at them, saying, F you f off like saying other things, too. I didn't hear all the things, but just so nasty. Yes, and none of it got caught. And so

64
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.269
Kristy Ouellette: the team was not reacting as much. They were more annoyed at Violet for being

65
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:22.259
Kristy Ouellette: more reactive in the way that, like she was in shock, that this was an acceptable behavior, because she knows that that's not a a way to play a game fairly like you have to have good sportsmanship.

66
00:13:22.632 --> 00:13:28.769
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah. And but but then the the T. Some of the teams were like, Why are you like they?

67
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:37.120
Kristy Ouellette: And so when we talk she was very angry, and I said, I have to drive home. You cannot have a freak out while I'm driving home. It's been a very long day.

68
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.820
Kristy Ouellette: and then when we got home, we talked about it more

69
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.660
Kristy Ouellette: after she was calm, and I said, Look.

70
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.490
Kristy Ouellette: I said, everybody deals with situations like that differently.

71
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:58.340
Kristy Ouellette: What you have to look to talk to people who will listen to you. But if you're not gonna be heard, then you you don't need to talk to those people about it. You can talk to somebody else.

72
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:12.150
Kristy Ouellette: I said, but you're more angry because of the way your team acted. But maybe they don't wanna discuss it. They don't want to deal with it because they're upset, too, and they're getting more upset because you you won't like everybody's different. You know what I mean. So.

73
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.090
Monifa McCarther: Yeah.

74
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.539
Kristy Ouellette: I said, don't be mad at your team.

75
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.779
Kristy Ouellette: They don't know how to handle it. They didn't want to talk about it. They didn't want to express it. And that's okay. But like.

76
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.089
Monifa McCarther: And who were the coaches throughout this whole thing?

77
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:31.540
Kristy Ouellette: The coach knew that it was happening, and the teammates were like, oh, this team's always like that.

78
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.779
Kristy Ouellette: and I was like

79
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.360
Kristy Ouellette: very close to like

80
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:48.810
Kristy Ouellette: finding out what could be done about it. But I just was kind of like, no, find the lesson here. Find the lesson here like like. Don't make a stink about this, because no one was hurt, or whatever but

81
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:59.390
Kristy Ouellette: and the worst part was the grandparents and all the people standing on the other side next to us. They were so nice, so I know they had no idea their team was being that nasty.

82
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.680
Kristy Ouellette: I know it

83
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.090
Kristy Ouellette: so

84
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:10.060
Kristy Ouellette: so it was a definitely a lesson, but it didn't keep her from saying that she's gonna go back next year. So that's good. And.

85
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.960
Monifa McCarther: And.

86
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:19.949
Kristy Ouellette: Tomorrow is their little. They have like a a grab bag thing where everyone gets a gift for like a secret, Santa, but it's not a. It's not Christmas

87
00:15:20.457 --> 00:15:22.610
Kristy Ouellette: but they get each other like a

88
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:30.402
Kristy Ouellette: gift, and they have snacks. So they have a party tomorrow after school in the coach's room, and she's a a 7th grade math teacher.

89
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:38.390
Kristy Ouellette: and then they'll exchange their things. And so and yesterday, when we were shopping, she was taking so long, and I'm like

90
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.690
Kristy Ouellette: it was fine, but the last she was so worried about not getting the perfect gift. So

91
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.589
Kristy Ouellette: there's still some triggering things there about worrying about what other people think. And I said.

92
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.930
Monifa McCarther: It's gonna be there for a while.

93
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.489
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And and more recently, we've had some

94
00:16:00.773 --> 00:16:03.940
Kristy Ouellette: eating disorder stuff like the eating disorder was the kind of like

95
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:14.609
Kristy Ouellette: not discussed as much, I think, like not not the talk, the the things that she would say, but more like.

96
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:23.129
Kristy Ouellette: There was no refusal to eat. There was no like there was no time. So okay, we're doing the same thing for breakfast and lunch every day. But you're eating.

97
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:29.460
Kristy Ouellette: And you're having. You're making time for your snack. And the coach says to everyone, All right, guys have your snack between now and then.

98
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:37.159
Kristy Ouellette: but more recently, she was like, I think I'm only going to have 3 meals and one snack

99
00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:39.950
Kristy Ouellette: and I'm like

100
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:48.170
Kristy Ouellette: I. I was very happy with myself because I was like, Okay, if that's what you think you should do. That's what I said, because

101
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.149
Kristy Ouellette: I think there was probably more than

102
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.450
Kristy Ouellette: that before, but there was. It was fine.

103
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.249
Kristy Ouellette: But when she's having

104
00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.169
Kristy Ouellette: more of that.

105
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.899
Kristy Ouellette: we're in this weird seesaw.

106
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.620
Kristy Ouellette: like. Usually it's me the one who's giving her the food but

107
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.120
Kristy Ouellette: the snacks! She was helping herself to extra snacks.

108
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.599
Kristy Ouellette: so

109
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.819
Kristy Ouellette: when she was having a moment of like relapse where she was like.

110
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:28.140
Kristy Ouellette: I don't know what I want to eat. I don't know. I go. Okay, how about this this and this? And I'll fix it. And then you come to the table once ready. So we kind of like reverted back to those the structure of me being the feeder, which is fine.

111
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:35.309
Monifa McCarther: Yeah, I think that needs to happen outside other than at school, where you have no control over it.

112
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:43.969
Kristy Ouellette: Yes, yes, so that's so. And then the same thing tonight, like I, I didn't have time to make a proper meal, but they haven't had chicken nuggets from Burger King, so

113
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:58.249
Kristy Ouellette: I grabbed an 8 piece chicken nugget for each of the girls, and then they had sides from home like I made a little salad for Violet, but she was kind of finicky about the salad part, but so she didn't eat the lettuce, but she ate the tomatoes. I'm like, Okay, fine.

114
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:06.670
Kristy Ouellette: But then, when she went to reach for the cookie, I go. No cookies are. Later I go. You can have a glass of milk. If you're hungry so, or you can have some bread, you're gonna have something something else.

115
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.880
Kristy Ouellette: because

116
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:16.840
Kristy Ouellette: I I don't. I she can have what she wants, but she can have it later, like you're if you're still hungry, then you need something with protein like you need to have something.

117
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.220
Kristy Ouellette: I don't know what a what a

118
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.000
Kristy Ouellette: we had over the last month, too! We had some like

119
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.790
Kristy Ouellette: a little bit of like

120
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:29.619
Kristy Ouellette: bingy binge, but now not not recently, not in the last couple of weeks.

121
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.200
Monifa McCarther: What did the benches look like.

122
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.010
Monifa McCarther: In front of you.

123
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:46.959
Kristy Ouellette: Kind of like like it could be like that. Maybe she had a meal, but then she made herself like a a milkshake.

124
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.380
Kristy Ouellette: And maybe it would just like keep going.

125
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.419
Kristy Ouellette: I don't know, but you know I have to say

126
00:18:55.430 --> 00:19:06.049
Kristy Ouellette: I thought about this, but I didn't tap into it until now, but now we're a year from last year last year we went trick or treating, and she had a bunch of candy, and she kept it in a Tupperware in a cabinet.

127
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.730
Kristy Ouellette: Okay, that's fine.

128
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.540
Kristy Ouellette: But she had her Halloween candy last year until

129
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:21.840
Kristy Ouellette: after Christmas, like even into close to Easter. The bin still had candy in it. She and that's not that was not a typical behavior for her

130
00:19:23.942 --> 00:19:29.040
Kristy Ouellette: so I thought that was odd last year before everything really blew up.

131
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.640
Kristy Ouellette: But this year we went to this

132
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.370
Kristy Ouellette: trick or treating thing downtown, and

133
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.450
Kristy Ouellette: they didn't really want to get.

134
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.519
Kristy Ouellette: They didn't want to stay and get as many stores as they wanted to. They just

135
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:55.339
Kristy Ouellette: did a couple of streets. And then they were like, Okay, I think we're good and it's getting crowded. Let's get out of here. And I'm like, Okay, so I think at least half her candy is still there, and the other half, and that was only 2 days ago, which is fine.

136
00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:02.629
Kristy Ouellette: Maybe they got 25 pieces of candy each, maybe 20. It wasn't that much, you know.

137
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:13.390
Kristy Ouellette: So that's fine. But last year I questioned why there was so much candy for so long, and I think that was when the eating disorder was starting to

138
00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.510
Kristy Ouellette: formulate it or show up.

139
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:17.940
Monifa McCarther: Yeah.

140
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:26.689
Kristy Ouellette: So we'll see with how the candy goes. The actual. Her behaviors are definitely changing, though.

141
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:33.460
Kristy Ouellette: which I think is progress, because it doesn't need to be dramatic. It doesn't need to be fixed in one day. It needs to be

142
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:39.369
Kristy Ouellette: like trying different things to see how it is like everything is kinda like

143
00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:47.320
Kristy Ouellette: big changes are not gonna be the way it's gonna be small

144
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.420
Kristy Ouellette: steps

145
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:53.949
Kristy Ouellette: like. So, for I don't think she ever really offered candy in the past

146
00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:14.179
Kristy Ouellette: unless she didn't like it, whereas she picked out 2 pieces of candy and said, Here, mom, this is for you. It's I know you like Twizzler, and I know you like M. And M's, and she gave it to me, and I was like, Wow, that's nice, but like I don't, I don't. I'm not. I don't care about the candy. I shouldn't even be. I always find a way to have a sweet, but you know.

147
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.780
Kristy Ouellette: So that was a that was a change, and

148
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:25.090
Kristy Ouellette: she was eat. She was enjoying the candy. She had a good time downtown. She was very funny when people saw her costume.

149
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:28.590
Kristy Ouellette: And

150
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.580
Kristy Ouellette: She seems to be in good spirits.

151
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.790
Kristy Ouellette: and

152
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.310
Kristy Ouellette: this is interesting. Last year she would be afraid

153
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.860
Kristy Ouellette: to be honest with her friends how she felt.

154
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:47.890
Kristy Ouellette: and this year her friend Les, who she went with

155
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:58.879
Kristy Ouellette: trick or treating last year with, she asked her to come again, and a new friend really, that she wanted to get to know better, asked her to go. How trick or treating so, Violet.

156
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.459
Kristy Ouellette: talk to me about it, and I said, Well.

157
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.849
Kristy Ouellette: you know I I told her a couple of things she could do, but she decided to have a frank conversation with

158
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.519
Kristy Ouellette: Alicia and say.

159
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:18.099
Kristy Ouellette: I hope you don't mind. I would really like to go with Anna trick or treating, and she goes. No, that's fine. She goes. I actually like that. You're being direct with me. It's totally fine.

160
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.970
Kristy Ouellette: because I know you're a good friend.

161
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.560
Kristy Ouellette: so.

162
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.020
Monifa McCarther: Wow!

163
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.669
Kristy Ouellette: I know in the past, when

164
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:35.140
Kristy Ouellette: Somebody talked about somebody, and Alicia was there, and Violet stuck up for the person. Alicia said, you're a good friend because you stick up for people

165
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.240
Kristy Ouellette: like when someone says something wrong about them or whatever.

166
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440
Kristy Ouellette: So

167
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.219
Kristy Ouellette: so she's making

168
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.220
Kristy Ouellette: good connections with other people her age

169
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.229
Kristy Ouellette: based on, like.

170
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.460
Kristy Ouellette: you know, like her standards kinda instead of she's I just feel like she's turned on the new week.

171
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.719
Kristy Ouellette: She likes to make people laugh.

172
00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.450
Kristy Ouellette: I think last year she was like afraid to talk.

173
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.399
Kristy Ouellette: her friend Lala is still her good friend.

174
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:10.260
Kristy Ouellette: but she's not hanging out with her as much because she doesn't like the.

175
00:23:11.218 --> 00:23:19.169
Kristy Ouellette: But she still picks up the phone when she calls, and they chat about other things and whatever. But she's she's.

176
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:33.220
Kristy Ouellette: I think it's good. Instead of her trying to fight a battle and be like a 3rd parent to Lala, she is just letting her do her own thing, but still valuing time with her when she's got time away from the other person.

177
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.980
Kristy Ouellette: So that's the best thing that she can do.

178
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:37.370
Monifa McCarther: Yes.

179
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:47.850
Kristy Ouellette: I'm like, that's like a huge deal, because she used to get like jealous of other people or whatever, and I'm sure she still gets a little jealous, but she's like that's not going to be the way. I'm not trying to

180
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.799
Kristy Ouellette: control anyone or protect anyone. That's not my job.

181
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.390
Kristy Ouellette: So

182
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:54.900
Kristy Ouellette: school.

183
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.260
Monifa McCarther: A lot of progress to me.

184
00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:01.339
Kristy Ouellette: It. It feels like a lot of progress, but we still have our moments of aggression. I'm just trying to

185
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.190
Kristy Ouellette: be more direct.

186
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.080
Monifa McCarther: What does that look like.

187
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:10.919
Kristy Ouellette: Mostly aimed at Penny. She's usually annoyed at Penny. I mean, there's some normal bickering and stuff. But like the

188
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:17.050
Kristy Ouellette: aggression is that she's trying to intimidate physically, Penny, because Penny, smaller than her.

189
00:24:17.461 --> 00:24:25.559
Kristy Ouellette: And it could be just the way that they've always operated. But you know we have a closer eye on it now, and it's not okay.

190
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:33.849
Kristy Ouellette: So I try to hold Violet more accountable. She needs that accountability when she's doing something. She knows she's not supposed to do immediately.

191
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.160
Kristy Ouellette: You can't.

192
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.770
Kristy Ouellette: You can't

193
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:42.380
Kristy Ouellette: always talk to her and convince her you have to

194
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.550
Kristy Ouellette: like speed up the consequence kinda with her.

195
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.050
Kristy Ouellette: And I I don't think I did that before as much now we do, because I see it. It makes a difference for her.

196
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.740
Kristy Ouellette: And and she's more remorseful. She never was remorseful when she was little, never

197
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.780
Kristy Ouellette: now she's more remorseful.

198
00:25:05.616 --> 00:25:08.159
Kristy Ouellette: So that's good. So.

199
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.290
Monifa McCarther: As with some maturity.

200
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.490
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah, we we talked about

201
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.600
Kristy Ouellette: field hockey camp, but we're not ready to do that.

202
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:21.679
Kristy Ouellette: So I made a deal that I would walk with her after school on Wednesdays and Sundays.

203
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:28.187
Monifa McCarther: How are you doing? Are you able to walk without pain? How? How was your

204
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.920
Monifa McCarther: pain been recently.

205
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.996
Kristy Ouellette: I'm trying a new supplement. I feel pretty good about it.

206
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:45.450
Kristy Ouellette: it's a supplement. It's not a prescription. I'm trying to kind of get away from prescriptions, because I think

207
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.179
Kristy Ouellette: not totally, but

208
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:57.870
Kristy Ouellette: it becomes a clutch, and you don't make any adjustments to your actual lifestyle, which is where the issue is, have to like radical acceptance. This is how my life is now. I have to adjust it so that I'm not

209
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:06.999
Kristy Ouellette: physically taxing myself, and I need to ask for help, or I need to take a break more. And then I can do these things that the kids want to do that are fun.

210
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240
Kristy Ouellette: So

211
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.179
Monifa McCarther: Sounds good in theory. Right?

212
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:18.760
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah, yeah, it's it's good. And we got. We got through the October birthday party, and it went

213
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.900
Kristy Ouellette: extremely well, which is shocking.

214
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.730
Kristy Ouellette: Tell me

215
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.030
Kristy Ouellette: like, I said, we're ordering pizza. I'm not cooking. I'm not.

216
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:27.610
Monifa McCarther: Yeah.

217
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.559
Kristy Ouellette: I really didn't.

218
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.420
Kristy Ouellette: I cleaned.

219
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:40.570
Kristy Ouellette: That was because I I thought I had more time. And then I had, you know, the the day of the game with the traffic. And all this, and

220
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:47.930
Kristy Ouellette: I don't know all these things that you forget, that are literally in in front of your face. But you don't have energy for everything. But it all worked out fine.

221
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:54.300
Kristy Ouellette: So Violet ate with everyone. She was in her room this time the whole time.

222
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.299
Monifa McCarther: Now, whose birthday was this.

223
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.619
Kristy Ouellette: It was Penelope and Rhiannon's birthday.

224
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.830
Monifa McCarther: Oh!

225
00:27:03.534 --> 00:27:04.259
Kristy Ouellette: So.

226
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.470
Monifa McCarther: Okay.

227
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.609
Kristy Ouellette: In the past. She would maybe be

228
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.779
Kristy Ouellette: jealous, because what we're both celebrating both sisters, but not me.

229
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.800
Kristy Ouellette: Right.

230
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.549
Monifa McCarther: Now it's not her birthday.

231
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:24.170
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah, no, she's she's she knows now. So it's not a big deal, but ironically, one it it's it's like

232
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:39.019
Kristy Ouellette: it. It went perfectly in the way that we invited our neighbors, and that's Miller and Grant, the boys next door. The girls go over there and hike and play outside, and they always hang out with those younger boys.

233
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:49.049
Kristy Ouellette: Parents and the whole family came over for the party, which was nice, because they're just lovely people, and they the parents, surprised Violet with a gift because

234
00:27:49.120 --> 00:28:04.159
Kristy Ouellette: they had gifts for the sisters and not her. So they and and so I mean. But she finally like accepted that and like understood, and it was fine, so she was totally, very, very thankful and grateful, and thanked them, and it was very sincere. It was sweet. And she

235
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:08.099
Kristy Ouellette: she so Sarah, next door is a great

236
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.480
Kristy Ouellette: other adults

237
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:18.199
Kristy Ouellette: like she's very calm. She's a human resources person, so she's trained in communication right?

238
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.359
Kristy Ouellette: And if there's issue

239
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:27.280
Kristy Ouellette: she always talks very directly to Violet, and Violet is very calm, totally

240
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:28.760
Kristy Ouellette: like

241
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:34.820
Kristy Ouellette: listens to what Sarah says, so she's a very good. They're good adults for her to be around.

242
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:40.140
Kristy Ouellette: and she trusts them because they're so careful with

243
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:48.459
Kristy Ouellette: every they're they're just nice people. So it was. It was good there. Oh, there was an issue with Miller. Miller's only

244
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:54.030
Kristy Ouellette: 6 or 7. He's in second grade, so he's going to be. It might be 7. But anyway.

245
00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:59.430
Kristy Ouellette: he called Violet big or something triggering.

246
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.480
Kristy Ouellette: so

247
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:12.159
Kristy Ouellette: I don't know what happened. But Violet was home, and then she told me about it later, and then I said, Look, this is. I said. He said other things before. He's a little kid. He does. The parents don't know. He's saying this, I said, you're really upset. I think it's a problem.

248
00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:28.230
Kristy Ouellette: So I was like, all ready to have a conversation with Sarah. And ironically Sarah, texted Violet and said, Could you please call us when you get a chance, because Miller would like to speak to you, but like I didn't say anything to Sarah. She has done that on her own accord, and then

249
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:35.449
Kristy Ouellette: we didn't call her back right away because Viola was making up excuses. And I said, Look, if you don't call her, I'm going to call her

250
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:36.660
Kristy Ouellette: because

251
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:47.079
Kristy Ouellette: I she doesn't know he's acting this way or saying these things, and she doesn't know the backstory, and she doesn't need to know everything. But she needs to know what her son's doing, because I'm sure she would not be okay with that right?

252
00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:55.662
Kristy Ouellette: And it's important because they're neighbors, and they hang out all the time. So it's not like a 1 shot deal, or in school, or whatever

253
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:02.215
Kristy Ouellette: we didn't call right away. And then Sarah sent a video of Miller apologizing.

254
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:12.539
Kristy Ouellette: and Violet felt better. And then she texted Sarah, and and it was fine, and then I saw Sarah at the party, and we talked just very briefly about it, and I

255
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:20.129
Kristy Ouellette: thanked her for going about it the way she did, I said, I don't think most parents would do what you did, but I really do appreciate it, you know.

256
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.709
Kristy Ouellette: So that is nice that she is finding adults that she can trust.

257
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.920
Kristy Ouellette: and she's also

258
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.060
Kristy Ouellette: exploring more

259
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.639
Kristy Ouellette: with people her age and like

260
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.970
Kristy Ouellette: I think she's looking at it differently than last year.

261
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.060
Kristy Ouellette: But

262
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:51.809
Kristy Ouellette: she is, you know, still having those. She was really angry about the the team, saying, getting mad at her for reacting the way she did about being upset about the kids, cursing and stuff and being so mean.

263
00:30:51.870 --> 00:31:06.419
Kristy Ouellette: But I think she was. She got worked up because she didn't have that much field time, but she was watching everyone else get discouraged. She's actually said that she goes. I was so upset. She's like everyone was really discouraged because the kids were being so mean like it changed the way they played.

264
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:07.880
Kristy Ouellette: you know.

265
00:31:11.278 --> 00:31:22.059
Kristy Ouellette: I I don't know what the answer is for that, because it was a reaction for her, and I don't know how much control she has over her reactions because she cares about the team.

266
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.260
Kristy Ouellette: but

267
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:25.799
Kristy Ouellette: I think.

268
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.899
Monifa McCarther: I think, for her it's the issue of fairness.

269
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:34.560
Monifa McCarther: and so she's kind of like black and white. When you're wrong. You're wrong when you're right. You're right.

270
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.200
Kristy Ouellette: That's true.

271
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.569
Monifa McCarther: So I think, for her, seeing that there's no consequence.

272
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.949
Monifa McCarther: It's almost like she had to say something.

273
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:48.160
Kristy Ouellette: Yes, she couldn't control it.

274
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:49.210
Kristy Ouellette: You're right.

275
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:50.550
Kristy Ouellette: You're right.

276
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:51.080
Monifa McCarther: Right.

277
00:31:51.080 --> 00:32:02.649
Kristy Ouellette: I know who she gets that from, but it's not from me. I only speak up when I need to. But anyway, let me see if I could find this child, because my phone is getting low, and I know we what.

278
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:03.500
Monifa McCarther: Oh, yeah.

279
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.500
Kristy Ouellette: We have some time.

280
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:12.039
Kristy Ouellette: I just want her to get blue. You can wait, sir. I saw her sneaking around the yard.

281
00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.170
Kristy Ouellette: Snows.

282
00:32:16.346 --> 00:32:17.810
Kristy Ouellette: She's up a hill

283
00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.999
Kristy Ouellette: and let me get her.

284
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:21.060
Kristy Ouellette: Sorry.

285
00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.110
Kristy Ouellette: Violet.

286
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.929
Kristy Ouellette: Come on. We just have a few minutes left.

287
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.900
Kristy Ouellette: You're going in the wrong direction.

288
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.510
Kristy Ouellette: Be careful.

289
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.510
Kristy Ouellette: Come down.

290
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.209
Kristy Ouellette: Okay. Here's the phone.

291
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:46.789
Kristy Ouellette: She's gonna talk to you, and she's working on a fort. I'm not sure what that means.

292
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.880
Kristy Ouellette: But

293
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:54.480
Kristy Ouellette: being productive is this, gonna be your project when Field hockey officially is over?

294
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.250
Kristy Ouellette: Oh.

295
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.540
Kristy Ouellette: is it a fort, or are you making? It's gonna be a home for for an animal this winter. Probably.

296
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.050
Kristy Ouellette: okay, I'll be nearby.

297
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.280
Kristy Ouellette: careful.

298
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.650
Kristy Ouellette: i'm, gonna.

299
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.260
Monifa McCarther: Yay!

300
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.110
Kristy Ouellette: I'm gonna

301
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.930
Kristy Ouellette: bye.

302
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.090
Kristy Ouellette: Okay.

303
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.219
Monifa McCarther: Hi, Violet, it's been a while. How have you been.

304
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.499
Kristy Ouellette: Oh, no.

305
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:36.780
Kristy Ouellette: I'm just grabbing my my phone so I can get straight to work. Once I go back up.

306
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.870
Monifa McCarther: Straight to work. What do you? What are you doing? Exactly.

307
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.630
Kristy Ouellette: I'm building a shelter.

308
00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.070
Monifa McCarther: Oh!

309
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.569
Kristy Ouellette: Out of sticks.

310
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.750
Monifa McCarther: Oh, wow!

311
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.229
Monifa McCarther: What made you decide to do this.

312
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.420
Kristy Ouellette: Well, I don't know.

313
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.729
Monifa McCarther: You just decided today to do it.

314
00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.540
Kristy Ouellette: Well, I started it when my penny had her birthday party.

315
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.269
Kristy Ouellette: So at this point I'm just collecting.

316
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.959
Kristy Ouellette: My goal is to make it withstand the winter.

317
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.360
Monifa McCarther: Hmm!

318
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.489
Monifa McCarther: It's.

319
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.110
Kristy Ouellette: So now I'm just grabbing wood.

320
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:16.869
Monifa McCarther: Okay.

321
00:34:18.279 --> 00:34:20.759
Monifa McCarther: Well, how have you been, can you?

322
00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:25.009
Monifa McCarther: Your hair has gotten so long.

323
00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.030
Kristy Ouellette: What?

324
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.440
Monifa McCarther: Your hair has gotten so long.

325
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.900
Kristy Ouellette: No, never put it down.

326
00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:31.229
Monifa McCarther: Oh.

327
00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:36.969
Monifa McCarther: so catch me up! How have you been.

328
00:34:38.196 --> 00:34:45.979
Kristy Ouellette: Field talking ended. Tomorrow's the last day where we're gonna see each other in time.

329
00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.420
Monifa McCarther: How are you feeling about that.

330
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.470
Kristy Ouellette: I'm okay, cause some of the girls I didn't really like.

331
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.050
Monifa McCarther: but this.

332
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.430
Kristy Ouellette: One Girl.

333
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.140
Monifa McCarther: Is one girl you really didn't like.

334
00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.050
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah. She was just annoying.

335
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.230
Monifa McCarther: Yeah, sometimes.

336
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.230
Kristy Ouellette: They can't be.

337
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.590
Kristy Ouellette: and I really don't think anyone truly liked her.

338
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.920
Monifa McCarther: So it's at least one. But overall you enjoyed it right.

339
00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.830
Kristy Ouellette: For the most part. Yeah.

340
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.460
Monifa McCarther: Well, good.

341
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.650
Kristy Ouellette: I'll put you again.

342
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.750
Monifa McCarther: All right.

343
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.879
Monifa McCarther: So is that what you've already started in the background?

344
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.110
Monifa McCarther: Oh.

345
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.930
Monifa McCarther: okay, you're making some progress.

346
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:38.180
Kristy Ouellette: What right now, what I'm doing is I'm lining them up this way.

347
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.530
Kristy Ouellette: So this is gonna be the more tedious.

348
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:48.979
Kristy Ouellette: There we go.

349
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.820
Monifa McCarther: Okay.

350
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.460
Kristy Ouellette: I'll just put my phone here.

351
00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.370
Kristy Ouellette: Now that

352
00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.990
Kristy Ouellette: this has been the more tedious thing.

353
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.450
Kristy Ouellette: Are, they have to line them up.

354
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:08.760
Monifa McCarther: Yeah.

355
00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:09.910
Kristy Ouellette: Oh!

356
00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:17.909
Monifa McCarther: Wow! Are you going to put some sort of tarp over top.

357
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:24.579
Kristy Ouellette: My goal is to make the. I want to make them so tightly together that it creates its own tarp.

358
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.090
Monifa McCarther: Wow!

359
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:28.979
Monifa McCarther: That's impressive.

360
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.149
Monifa McCarther: So how long do you think this will will take?

361
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.000
Monifa McCarther: It's a.

362
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.520
Kristy Ouellette: Depends on how fast I'm working.

363
00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:40.400
Kristy Ouellette: To grab something.

364
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.199
Kristy Ouellette: The issue is, there's this big.

365
00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.189
Kristy Ouellette: there's like.

366
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:08.220
Kristy Ouellette: what is it? A moat? There's like a moat of an outline of a moat, because all of this there's barbed wire. This used to be a sheet pen.

367
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.630
Monifa McCarther: Oh.

368
00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.120
Monifa McCarther: okay.

369
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:12.850
Kristy Ouellette: So

370
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:18.769
Kristy Ouellette: there's a big mow, and I have to rake the leaves out of it, because I'll go to step on the leaves, and then I'll fall.

371
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:19.830
Monifa McCarther: Oh.

372
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:21.110
Monifa McCarther: okay.

373
00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:26.279
Kristy Ouellette: Cause. I think the moat is a lot steeper, like, less steep than it is, but it's really deep.

374
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.240
Kristy Ouellette: So.

375
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.809
Monifa McCarther: It's a lot going on, but that definitely keeps you busy and occupied. Huh!

376
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:39.830
Monifa McCarther: And you enjoy it.

377
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:46.860
Kristy Ouellette: Florida. I wanna ask my dad if he could chainsaw one of the thingies down, cause it's in the way.

378
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:54.690
Kristy Ouellette: And like, if I want to make it more compacted. I need some of the sticks out, so I'm gonna ask if he could chainsaw some of them.

379
00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:02.860
Kristy Ouellette: The only issue is, I have to be careful when I'm out here, because of all the coyotes and bears.

380
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.549
Monifa McCarther: You have bears too.

381
00:38:06.561 --> 00:38:10.540
Kristy Ouellette: There was coyotes. I was at my neighbor's and it was dark

382
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.399
Kristy Ouellette: and we heard something and there were a pack of coyotes, just staring at us.

383
00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:16.150
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah.

384
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.936
Monifa McCarther: I do?

385
00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:18.960
Kristy Ouellette: I ran away.

386
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.860
Monifa McCarther: Are you supposed to run? I thought you weren't supposed to run

387
00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.510
Monifa McCarther: cause. Don't they chase you if you run.

388
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:30.600
Kristy Ouellette: That's bears. You're not supposed to run for bears. You're supposed to start screaming.

389
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.760
Monifa McCarther: Oh!

390
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:35.930
Kristy Ouellette: Chilly.

391
00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:40.270
Monifa McCarther: No, no!

392
00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:44.849
Monifa McCarther: So that's going to protect protect what animals will be in there

393
00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.470
Monifa McCarther: like smaller.

394
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:47.660
Kristy Ouellette: What am I making.

395
00:38:50.067 --> 00:38:53.330
Kristy Ouellette: I'm not making it for any particular reason.

396
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:57.089
Kristy Ouellette: I'm just making it cause I'm bored. But probably

397
00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:02.619
Kristy Ouellette: foxes, deers, any animals that tend to create burrows.

398
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:19.560
Kristy Ouellette: Maybe frogs will be near the all the leaves and stuff that will be composed. But right now, so I don't know how many animals.

399
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.010
Monifa McCarther: Gotcha

400
00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.210
Monifa McCarther: all right.

401
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.310
Monifa McCarther: Well, how has school been going.

402
00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.619
Kristy Ouellette: School school. I don't like kids.

403
00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:35.260
Monifa McCarther: Would you say if you compare last year to this year? What would you say.

404
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.150
Kristy Ouellette: It's a little bit less as bad.

405
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.619
Monifa McCarther: Okay, I'll take that.

406
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.709
Monifa McCarther: Your mom said that you were diagnosed with dyslexia.

407
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:46.730
Kristy Ouellette: Yep.

408
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.370
Monifa McCarther: How do you feel about that.

409
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.540
Kristy Ouellette: I guess it makes sense.

410
00:39:54.240 --> 00:40:00.719
Monifa McCarther: sometimes when people find out that they have it, they're relieved because it makes sense

411
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.180
Monifa McCarther: why

412
00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:04.910
Monifa McCarther: things weren't

413
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.830
Monifa McCarther: making sense for you or wasn't as easy as it should have been.

414
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.480
Kristy Ouellette: Yeah.

415
00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.240
Monifa McCarther: Yeah.

416
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.670
Kristy Ouellette: What the heck! -Oh.

417
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.620
Monifa McCarther: I see you.

418
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.500
Kristy Ouellette: It's at 4%.

419
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.750
Monifa McCarther: Oh, Lord, okay.

420
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.690
Monifa McCarther: Well, in a nutshell

421
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.189
Monifa McCarther: things are going well with field hockey.

422
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:31.210
Monifa McCarther: Things are going pretty well with school. Any issues.

423
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:33.039
Kristy Ouellette: No, not really.

424
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.160
Monifa McCarther: No, you getting along with your sister.

425
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.260
Kristy Ouellette: But that's school.

426
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:38.880
Monifa McCarther: What is.

427
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.969
Kristy Ouellette: People being annoying, or people making mean, snippy comments.

428
00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.000
Monifa McCarther: Hmm!

429
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:46.640
Monifa McCarther: If they do.

430
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.200
Kristy Ouellette: How school is.

431
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.750
Monifa McCarther: Yeah, and you're able to ignore it better than you have been.

432
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:53.570
Kristy Ouellette: I don't know.

433
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.190
Monifa McCarther: Is that something you want to do? Try to ignore it.

434
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:02.860
Kristy Ouellette: I not ignore it, but just not care about it?

435
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.980
Monifa McCarther: Okay.

436
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.050
Monifa McCarther: well, how are you feeling about not caring.

437
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.890
Kristy Ouellette: I just I don't know.

438
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:18.419
Monifa McCarther: Cause. That's easier said than done. Sometimes you do care when

439
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.780
Monifa McCarther: people just being mean, but sometimes just letting go of it.

440
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:29.470
Monifa McCarther: not trying to figure out why people do what they do, and just letting it go sometimes. That's good, too.

441
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.640
Monifa McCarther: and you won't let it bother you.

442
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.300
Monifa McCarther: you know.

443
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.740
Monifa McCarther: Hello.

444
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.210
Kristy Ouellette: What?

445
00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:45.970
Monifa McCarther: Okay.

446
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.020
Monifa McCarther: did you hear what I said?

447
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.670
Monifa McCarther: If that phone's probably about to die.

448
00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:52.459
Kristy Ouellette: It's at one.

449
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.370
Monifa McCarther: Oh, okay. Well, I'll say bye. Now.

450
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.860
Kristy Ouellette: Sorry I just

451
00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.969
Kristy Ouellette: I don't know.

452
00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.200
Monifa McCarther: That's okay.

453
00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:02.399
Kristy Ouellette: Oh, I left my chromebook up here.

454
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:08.289
Monifa McCarther: Okay? Well, I'll see you later. It was good seeing you okay before we get cut off.
