00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.320
Maria Minina (she/her): Hello!

2
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.250
Taylor Macdonald: Wow!

3
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.410
Maria Minina (she/her): Oh!

4
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.929
Taylor Macdonald: There we go!

5
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.330
Maria Minina (she/her): I recognize the background. Are you guys back in California.

6
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.340
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

7
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.270
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay.

8
00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.929
Taylor Macdonald: That's funny.

9
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.349
Maria Minina (she/her): How's it going.

10
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.270
Taylor Macdonald: Good! How are you?

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.340
Maria Minina (she/her): I'm all right. Pretty good.

12
00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:42.490
Maria Minina (she/her): I guess you guys made it back to California now it's gotten chilly. A chillier.

13
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.089
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, we just finished visiting our family in Nevada. So we're back now.

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.090
Maria Minina (she/her): Nice

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.910
Maria Minina (she/her): you guys are all, do you guys have family all over? Or do you just like in Wyoming.

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.609
Taylor Macdonald: No, we don't have family in Wyoming.

17
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.279
Maria Minina (she/her): Got it. Well.

18
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.490
Maria Minina (she/her): I'm envious of your adventures, so.

19
00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:02.346
Taylor Macdonald: Please. Move around.

20
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.996
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah. Well, I definitely want to thank you for getting in the way a couple on Monday.

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.190
Maria Minina (she/her): it like me. You're kind of like maintaining

22
00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:17.500
Maria Minina (she/her): last week. I we're using. Are we still okay with using numbers.

23
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:18.750
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

24
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.610
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, yeah. Cause last week

25
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.120
Maria Minina (she/her): mom puts the weights in twice a week. But I usually just do like the week to week. So you were 103.6. Now you're 104. So like maintaining.

26
00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:40.710
Taylor Macdonald: And then there was one day that we didn't. Log, I was at 1, 0, 4.8, and then I dropped down to 1 0 4, so like it's like on and off.

27
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.969
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, yeah, that makes sense, I mean, and that can.

28
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:56.850
Maria Minina (she/her): And that's why I like to say that it's like maintained when it's more in the decimals, because right like we could get gassy, and that could increase our weight a little bit and things like that. So, but it is good to hear.

29
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.600
Maria Minina (she/her): What did you think when you saw 104.8.

30
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.209
Taylor Macdonald: I was happier that it was going up.

31
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.910
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

32
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:04.630
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

33
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.420
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay.

34
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.559
Maria Minina (she/her): did it? Cause I know you've been preparing, or at least

35
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.820
Maria Minina (she/her): helping out with making your meals.

36
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.649
Maria Minina (she/her): Did it impact

37
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.110
Maria Minina (she/her): your ability to do that in any way.

38
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:36.010
Taylor Macdonald: No I was still well, it was kind of hard because we were in our trailer to like keep eating like bigger, fuller meals like at a specific time. So that was one thing I think started making me go like up and down, because it's like, Oh, I'm eating food now, but then I'm not eating it. Later, when I need it.

39
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.640
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

40
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.999
Taylor Macdonald: So. Yeah, but I tried to keep him

41
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.770
Taylor Macdonald: pretty like.

42
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.670
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

43
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.120
Maria Minina (she/her): definitely.

44
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:53.849
Maria Minina (she/her): No. And I I mean, I can even imagine it getting more difficult if it's like just feeling discomfort like, Oh, I don't wanna make myself something. Give myself a stomach ache like.

45
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.690
Taylor Macdonald: Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.615
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

47
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.277
Taylor Macdonald: You do worry about that. Oh, no.

48
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.799
Maria Minina (she/her): That's 1 thing that kinda gets you worked up.

49
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:21.870
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, because sometimes I'll eat something like that is like my stomach just is like, Oh, that does not feel good right now. Here, too, like we made quinoa and stuff to have in the fridge. And then she made herself a salad quinoa to it. So she did, but it was getting bigger and bigger. She wanted to add more and more stuff to it.

50
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:30.709
Taylor Macdonald: And then I looked at. I'm like, let's just cut this in half and start with half. So that way, if you feel full, you can save it for later, and it doesn't get wasted. And then you still have. So she actually

51
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.970
Taylor Macdonald: ate the other half the next day. Right? Because I'm like, that's getting kind of big. Is that what's good.

52
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.849
Maria Minina (she/her): In Italy, no.

53
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.510
Taylor Macdonald: I was just worried how she would feel.

54
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.450
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, no, Marissa, was it also like

55
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.150
Maria Minina (she/her): not wanting to?

56
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.129
Maria Minina (she/her): I just give her that like negative experience of volume, and then like, totally scare her away from it.

57
00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:02.790
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah. So because I said, Okay, we're gonna have this half and then eat that. And if you want it, you're totally come back and get it. But after that she was like, I think I'll wait a while. Yeah, that's fine.

58
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:11.290
Maria Minina (she/her): And like so sounds like, maybe, Taylor, you've been trying to kind of fit into that equip plate.

59
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:13.419
Taylor Macdonald: yeah.

60
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.079
Maria Minina (she/her): Tell me more about that cause. I do know

61
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.049
Maria Minina (she/her): Carbs are something that at least at some point, maybe not as much now, but your eating disorder was hung up on.

62
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:42.310
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, I. Well, I go back sometimes, and I'll like, Go on her phone and find, like the little image of the plate, and like what the portion should be. So I like, remember, I'm like, Oh, like 50% grain, 50% grain. So I try to do that. And then I'm all like, okay veggies and then fruit. And then

63
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:55.510
Taylor Macdonald: you got the protein. So I try to try and measure everything out like to try and make sure it's like enough of what I need. But then, also, I don't want to focus too much on it. Because then people are gonna be like, why are you focusing so hard on it? Because.

64
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.149
Maria Minina (she/her): That would be my next question of like, Are are you finding yourself now hung up on the portion sizes.

65
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:11.870
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, I try. I try not to like be too concerned about it, because everybody everybody's gonna call me out for something, even if I don't realize they're gonna be like, are you

66
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.830
Taylor Macdonald: like messed up like on this.

67
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.860
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, everyone has eyes on you right now.

68
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.940
Taylor Macdonald: They do?

69
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.872
Maria Minina (she/her): They do? They do?

70
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:36.530
Taylor Macdonald: She was eating usually when we're home. If we're at a restaurant she'll eat corn tortillas, but at home she usually eats like her cassava, or like alternate ones. But last night she did eat the corn tortillas, and then, like the starch portion.

71
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:45.100
Taylor Macdonald: And the night before we had like nachos with like corn tortillas since we didn't, or corn chips because we didn't have tortillas.

72
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.919
Taylor Macdonald: so I still tried to get like enough chips, and like we put a little bit of rice and.

73
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.540
Maria Minina (she/her): Hmm.

74
00:05:51.273 --> 00:05:54.940
Taylor Macdonald: Just quinoa yeah, quinoa and

75
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:10.320
Taylor Macdonald: beef, and like avocado and stuff like that. So a bunch of like good stuff, I think that I was supposed to be having, but I was still trying to focus on like I need the grain. So I guess I need to put like more of that than like veggies. Usually I'll be like, oh, I would like more veggies than.

76
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.850
Maria Minina (she/her): Like.

77
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.609
Taylor Macdonald: Other things. Yeah.

78
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.990
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, that

79
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:21.429
Maria Minina (she/her): I think that's a lot of people's default, right? And so you're also breaking that kind of like cultural habit, too.

80
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.910
Maria Minina (she/her): like, so

81
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.505
Maria Minina (she/her): cause

82
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:36.650
Maria Minina (she/her): you might just be how you phrased it. But now I'm not like catching exactly the words, but like when you mentioned tortilla chips, it sounded a little bit more like

83
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.799
Maria Minina (she/her): I had to have tortilla chips in it.

84
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.710
Maria Minina (she/her): cause that's a carb also, is it like?

85
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.120
Maria Minina (she/her): Is it labeled differently in your mind than like quinoa.

86
00:06:47.960 --> 00:07:01.400
Taylor Macdonald: No? Well, it's just different, in a way, because it's like 2 different types of things. And I think that honestly, I don't even know I just kind of like think I'm all like quinoa, I guess, has like

87
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:14.590
Taylor Macdonald: more benefits because it has like protein, and it's a more of like a fiber, and then corn's kind of just like all it is is a grain. It doesn't have protein. It doesn't have all the other stuff, but I like them both. I don't think.

88
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.020
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay.

89
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.040
Taylor Macdonald: Them are like bad for me. Really.

90
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.553
Maria Minina (she/her): Maybe Mom can offer some feedback, too. Once you answer, and then

91
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:33.219
Maria Minina (she/her): because I know you're trying not to worry. But obviously the worry is still there about portioning and and all of that

92
00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:36.970
Maria Minina (she/her): does it feel like when that's happening?

93
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.599
Maria Minina (she/her): Does it feel like it's kind of coming from more of a place of

94
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.250
Maria Minina (she/her): perfectionism, and getting it right, or more about

95
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.590
Maria Minina (she/her): like

96
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.509
Maria Minina (she/her): still maintaining some strictness with

97
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.069
Maria Minina (she/her): still maintaining that, like strict control over what's actually going in your body.

98
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:06.069
Taylor Macdonald: A little bit of both, I guess, cause I do like to. I do want to make sure that I am doing it right. But then I also, I do like to have control over it, like, okay.

99
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.929
Taylor Macdonald: if this is perfect enough, then I'm gonna be happy.

100
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:24.260
Taylor Macdonald: It's like I'm doing it right, because I don't want to end up like accidentally, because I probably will end up. If I don't like. Think about that all the time, I'll probably end up putting like half the plate is veggies, and then like a little bit of grain. And then I'm like, Wait. I wasn't supposed to do that.

101
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.120
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay.

102
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.110
Maria Minina (she/her): Mom, what about you? What's what's been your impression.

103
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.879
Taylor Macdonald: No, I think that's true, too.

104
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:39.289
Taylor Macdonald: Yes, she's yeah, we're both just trying to figure in, you know, more grains now and think about like. Oh, wait! Half of this is supposed to be that, or tortillas count for that. So.

105
00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:39.829
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

106
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.320
Taylor Macdonald: Let's get more of that in.

107
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.063
Taylor Macdonald: But it's good. I mean she. Today we just got

108
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.919
Taylor Macdonald: thrive market. She we just got

109
00:08:48.050 --> 00:09:02.370
Taylor Macdonald: her. Would you get rolled oats? Yeah, we just got oats and gluten free, organic. So she's gonna do those. So we're just trying to figure out what she she likes looking at all the ingredients on everything. So it's like it has to be something. Okay. We can't find this one at the store. So we're ordering this one or

110
00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.143
Taylor Macdonald: right? Yeah.

111
00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.550
Maria Minina (she/her): Let's cool

112
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.760
Maria Minina (she/her): enlighten me. I've never compared ingredients on oats.

113
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.885
Taylor Macdonald: Well,

114
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:31.949
Taylor Macdonald: Some of them aren't gluten free, and it's not that they necessarily have gluten in them. But I read that I was look. I was curious, because I'm all like what makes oats not gluten free, because, like they're all naturally gluten free, I'm like, do they put like flour or something on them, so they don't stick, or it's just like the processing, I guess. So like they put them

115
00:09:31.950 --> 00:10:00.449
Taylor Macdonald: like through a space that has like wheat or something. So it's just been contaminated. So that's what I gotta look for is, cause I'm like, I don't necessarily know if that would bug me too much, but I just don't know if that would bug me. So I try to look for like that like, just to make sure it's like gluten free, and that kind of stuff, and most of the time like even when we went to like when we were traveling and we went to the gas station. I was looking at all the protein bars, and most of them had milk, so like everybody.

116
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.729
Taylor Macdonald: was probably like looking at me like, why is she staring at all the granola bars.

117
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:10.910
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, but you're kind of you are cornered into checking labels because of your your allergies.

118
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.035
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

119
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.807
Maria Minina (she/her): And you know I.

120
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.920
Taylor Macdonald: Oh, I was gonna say, and then with the organic ones, it's because of the pesticides on the

121
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.269
Taylor Macdonald: on the oats.

122
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:21.900
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, yeah.

123
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.270
Taylor Macdonald: Diet, organic, then.

124
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.369
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, that makes sense.

125
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.440
Taylor Macdonald: Because of. They're not susceptible to pesticides.

126
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.439
Maria Minina (she/her): Got it. Okay? So that's what you're looking at.

127
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.360
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

128
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.190
Maria Minina (she/her): I mean.

129
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:42.320
Maria Minina (she/her): it makes sense not to want to test out your tolerance of gluten right now. That can come at a later date when you're just more comfortable getting food in, anyway.

130
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.990
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

131
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.710
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay. Gosh.

132
00:10:45.082 --> 00:10:50.159
Maria Minina (she/her): it's really, it's really, really cool to see how enthusiastic you are. And like.

133
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.529
Maria Minina (she/her): I mean, your willingness to still be like, yeah, I have some hangups, but

134
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.515
Maria Minina (she/her): it's really cool to see you're challenging yourself and

135
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:09.629
Maria Minina (she/her): are you starting to see? And this is for mom, too. Are you guys starting to see any places where maybe you will need support.

136
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:26.370
Taylor Macdonald: I think every place that I might need support. They're already kind of like helping me with like if I say like, I don't really like, feel like eating right there. Now, they're like, it's been like 4 h. You would need to at least eat like a handful of nuts or something. I'm like, okay, fine.

137
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.112
Maria Minina (she/her): Good job, mom.

138
00:11:27.767 --> 00:11:34.289
Taylor Macdonald: Or not so much water. Because I'm like, Okay, that's enough. Now you need to eat.

139
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:34.870
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

140
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.979
Taylor Macdonald: And then in a while you can have some more, but really trying to still

141
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.268
Taylor Macdonald: watch the ounces of water right? That's because she'll just keep drinking water, and we're like Nope, that's enough.

142
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:59.749
Taylor Macdonald: More, just like a like a reflex. Now it's just like I ate. Now I'm gonna drink some water, and then, like I get, I forget about eating again, because I'm all like I've been drinking water for like the past hour. So I'm like, I feel even more full than I did 20 min ago.

143
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.980
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, okay, yeah.

144
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.369
Maria Minina (she/her): mom's already doing it. But yeah, keep an eye on that water.

145
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.570
Maria Minina (she/her): Because I can also see it being like, you know we have taken away a lot of your exercise and your

146
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.800
Maria Minina (she/her): pop, your

147
00:12:13.145 --> 00:12:24.649
Maria Minina (she/her): your brain is a little less busy thinking about the next way to support this eating disorder. So it also makes sense to have that reflex of like, I'm bored. I'm gonna pick up my water and chug it.

148
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.270
Maria Minina (she/her): So yeah.

149
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.489
Maria Minina (she/her): you and an eye on that. Okay.

150
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.400
Maria Minina (she/her): what about you, mom, are you in dad? Finding areas where

151
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.550
Maria Minina (she/her): you're you're running into any concerns or anything.

152
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:46.989
Taylor Macdonald: I don't think so. She's been doing really good, like she does research her food or stuff, but letting her still, you know, pick out which things she wants to eat like yesterday.

153
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:58.800
Taylor Macdonald: What'd you have? She had like a breakfast burrito with some. I think I had rice in it, too. Right the quinoa, sweet potatoes, oh, sweet potato and eggs and veggies and tortilla, and then today she wanted

154
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.520
Taylor Macdonald: oatmeal.

155
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:09.619
Taylor Macdonald: and then something else, and then tomorrow she'll probably have her overnight oats or something, but it's just still trying to figure out what she wants to eat. But how we're fitting it in with those grains and.

156
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.230
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

157
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.220
Taylor Macdonald: Different

158
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.210
Taylor Macdonald: different stuff.

159
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.349
Taylor Macdonald: But that's all. I think. Just making sure there's that available to what she.

160
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.940
Taylor Macdonald: you know, wants to eat or feels like eating. It's not the same thing every day. Yeah.

161
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.710
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay.

162
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.809
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, everything's going. Okay.

163
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.680
Maria Minina (she/her): That's good, Taylor. Then I'm gonna

164
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.582
Maria Minina (she/her): another hypothetical, I guess. But

165
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:41.969
Maria Minina (she/her): If you do start fall when, as this meal, as you continue following this meal. I'm going to say it that way. As you continue following the meal, plan and and time progresses.

166
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:51.159
Maria Minina (she/her): we are going to start seeing changes in your weight and your body. And I want to start, maybe talking about how

167
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.379
Maria Minina (she/her): how we can support you around that especially, how like mom can

168
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.150
Maria Minina (she/her): And so

169
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.079
Maria Minina (she/her): again, I'm going to kind of ask you to to to fortune tell. But

170
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.850
Maria Minina (she/her): when you're thinking about that, where do you see the issues coming up.

171
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.550
Taylor Macdonald: Hmm!

172
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.970
Taylor Macdonald: Trying to think

173
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.040
Taylor Macdonald: the issues

174
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.509
Taylor Macdonald: that I think about like when I think about gaining weight. Is that what you're asking.

175
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:33.330
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah. Like, if I'm like Taylor, your body's gonna change a little bit. It's right. We're gonna start probably seeing some weight gain.

176
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.799
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, I don't really. I don't see like

177
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.150
Taylor Macdonald: too much, I guess, of an issue with that I

178
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.429
Taylor Macdonald: I want to be more healthy. But I just

179
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:59.209
Taylor Macdonald: like I told you before, like I don't really want to be like back up to where I started, and if I do gain a little bit of weight. And I do like, get a little bit like if I gain weight, and it's a little more visible than where I am now. That's okay.

180
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:07.050
Taylor Macdonald: But yeah, I just don't really want to be like back up to where I started. And I know I probably won't have to do that.

181
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.389
Taylor Macdonald: But if I if I have to gain a little, and it makes me just a tiny bit bigger, that's that's okay.

182
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.576
Maria Minina (she/her): Well, you know her better, but I wasn't very convinced by that tone of voice. At the end.

183
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.500
Taylor Macdonald: Well.

184
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.399
Taylor Macdonald: my concern. Well.

185
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.160
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

186
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.299
Taylor Macdonald: We we went while we were in Wyoming, to.

187
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.030
Maria Minina (she/her): Mom might just notice stuff you don't notice, that's all.

188
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:39.669
Taylor Macdonald: Well to get jeans, and she was getting really, really frustrated with buying clothes. So that's my only thing is that I think the whole clothes thing is gonna be frustrating.

189
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.570
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

190
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:50.705
Taylor Macdonald: Because I was being at the store was frustrating. It was. It wasn't frustrating, because everything was like too small or anything. It was like the fact that

191
00:15:51.390 --> 00:16:03.530
Taylor Macdonald: it was. It wasn't even like the sizing. It was more of just like the fit of certain jeans like, because, like different fabrics fit me differently, and it was like 2 sizes fit me. But somehow, like the

192
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:15.440
Taylor Macdonald: the bigger ones fit me better because they felt almost smaller. So it was like confusing. I'm like the bigger ones feel smaller, but the smaller ones feel like looser. How does that work?

193
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.190
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

194
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.870
Maria Minina (she/her): Have you ever talked to more about this? Or have you noticed how

195
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:26.990
Maria Minina (she/her): women's clothing sizes are not the same across the board.

196
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:37.829
Taylor Macdonald: I've told her even the same like I used to go to express jeans all the time, and there'd be the same pants in a different color, but they would not fit the same. They'd all be so yeah.

197
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:49.760
Maria Minina (she/her): No, I it's i i've had. I've had teams. Show me after they go shopping like this is a size. This this is a size this, and they're holding them all up. And they're the exact same size, right?

198
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.150
Maria Minina (she/her): And

199
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:56.809
Maria Minina (she/her): you being a like a young woman, you are facing that unique challenge of like

200
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.540
Maria Minina (she/her): boys, just measure their waist and their leg length.

201
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.410
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

202
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.940
Maria Minina (she/her): All they need to know.

203
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.910
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, sure.

204
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.670
Maria Minina (she/her): Forced to try on clothes to see if they fit.

205
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:33.649
Taylor Macdonald: Yes, and I noticed, too, because, like, when I would get like closer if I would look on like the measurements online. And I measured myself. I measured like the waist, and then I measured like my hips, and then my leg length, and I noticed that my hips are like smaller than normal. So everything that I get is going to be baggy around my hips. Because then I look at the measurement. And it's all like, okay, if you have like a 27 waist you should have like a 37 hip. I'm like.

206
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.900
Taylor Macdonald: my hips are like 34. So it's like smaller.

207
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.190
Maria Minina (she/her): You're also a kid. Yeah.

208
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:48.639
Taylor Macdonald: Yes, it's like smaller and smaller. I'm like, everything's gonna be like, if the waist gets too big, then, like these pants are gonna fall, because, like I have no hips to hold them up.

209
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.990
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah. So so then you're forced to try on clothes in person.

210
00:17:51.990 --> 00:18:03.039
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah. And then I I told my mom all like those like kids jeans that have like the buttons, and like the the elastic, where you can tighten them. I'm like those should be like in all jeans, because.

211
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.164
Maria Minina (she/her): You just brought back a memory for me.

212
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:13.700
Taylor Macdonald: I'm like. Everybody deserves those buttons and elastics, because, like, if you can tighten it more or loosen it, it would be perfect.

213
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.150
Maria Minina (she/her): And Mcdonald for president. That is a great idea.

214
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.820
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, that's.

215
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:24.990
Maria Minina (she/her): Beautiful. Yeah. Okay, so that so just the inconsistencies were frustrating.

216
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:41.270
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, that would. That was the thing. It was just like trying to figure out and also trying to think about like what size was going to fit me better. And then I also think about like, Oh, if I wash it, is it going to get too small? Or if I wear it enough. Is it going to break in and stretch out too big? And that ended up kind of being the

217
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:48.819
Taylor Macdonald: disappointing part, because I got the gns and then. Now they're kind of too big, and I'm all like, oh, I should have gotten the smaller ones.

218
00:18:51.085 --> 00:18:51.995
Taylor Macdonald: Okay. Yeah.

219
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:53.900
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay, yeah.

220
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.430
Maria Minina (she/her): Was there any part of you that

221
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.889
Maria Minina (she/her): like cause? I know logically, you, you understand this part, that the

222
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.898
Maria Minina (she/her): especially Jean sizes are not uniform.

223
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.180
Maria Minina (she/her): Was there any part of you, though, while you were shopping? Where.

224
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.019
Maria Minina (she/her): when you tried on a size that was

225
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.879
Maria Minina (she/her): bigger, you like had a judgment about that.

226
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:17.870
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

227
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:29.769
Taylor Macdonald: No, not really because I I do keep that in mind. I'm like, well, different things fit in different ways. And then, like the I feel like almost sometimes it's like

228
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:35.309
Taylor Macdonald: bigger is better, because that way it also has room to shrink.

229
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:44.699
Taylor Macdonald: Or if you get it smaller, it's gonna be too small. So I'm not. I'm not like opposed to sizing up, because that's fine.

230
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:54.100
Taylor Macdonald: and that will give me room to either like get taller or like. Whatever happens, it like, has room to shrink it as

231
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.859
Taylor Macdonald: like more

232
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.869
Taylor Macdonald: flexibility. So we don't have to buy more.

233
00:19:59.050 --> 00:19:59.700
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

234
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.320
Maria Minina (she/her): Are, are these the internal conversations you have with yourself?

235
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:13.737
Taylor Macdonald: Well, sometimes. Yeah. Cause I'll try and think about it. I'm like, well, what is the best thing I can do? So I can get these without having to like them be like, oh, they don't fit anymore. We gotta buy new ones.

236
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:18.530
Maria Minina (she/her): I'm just. I'm very impressed by it, and your ability to like check the facts

237
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.970
Maria Minina (she/her): of a situation.

238
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:27.620
Taylor Macdonald: She tells me about that all the time, too. She's like, well, remember, don't get them too small, because if, like, they shrink in the wash. Then they're gonna be small.

239
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:27.950
Maria Minina (she/her): Yes.

240
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.769
Taylor Macdonald: Right after we buy them. Yeah.

241
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.030
Maria Minina (she/her): Definitely. Yeah.

242
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:38.890
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay, so maybe. So that that's a a delicate thing. Right now, a little bit delicate brings up some feelings.

243
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.780
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, yeah.

244
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:47.000
Maria Minina (she/her): I think it's really cool, too, that though, that you were still willing and able to go shopping.

245
00:20:47.590 --> 00:21:07.470
Taylor Macdonald: I, yeah, I really, I enjoy shopping a lot, because then I like seeing all like the new things and seeing like what types of different like clothing is there? Because you don't get to see everything like online, like you can go find like brand new stuff like you've never seen before in the store it could be by the same company. You look online, and it's not there.

246
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.875
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

247
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:17.880
Taylor Macdonald: I like just going into store personally, because you can see all the stuff that's actually there. And then you you have to try it on most of the time. It's so hard to order stuff online.

248
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.490
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

249
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:24.740
Maria Minina (she/her): do you? Do you enjoy like fashion as a concept? Cause you said like looking at the different clothes and.

250
00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:31.409
Taylor Macdonald: Oh, yeah, I really I do. I like looking at all the different stuff. And in here she

251
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:39.309
Taylor Macdonald: what's the is it still procreate? She draws dresses and designs, dresses and stuff on, procreate.

252
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.070
Taylor Macdonald: so that.

253
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.990
Maria Minina (she/her): You. You don't have to, but you have to share that with me.

254
00:21:43.990 --> 00:22:00.339
Taylor Macdonald: I do interior design again when she gets older. So I was trying to look for schools again while we were traveling, and but the only one I could find was, you had to be 16

255
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.130
Taylor Macdonald: to do an online one to get a degree. So not that far away, Nope, the other one.

256
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.630
Maria Minina (she/her): No, I'm like not that. Far away.

257
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.040
Taylor Macdonald: 18. So.

258
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.779
Taylor Macdonald: But yeah, we were trying to find classes for her to do. But she really likes

259
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.129
Taylor Macdonald: clothing, design, and like home design.

260
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.009
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, that's cool.

261
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.939
Maria Minina (she/her): hey? Make inclusive clothing.

262
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.020
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

263
00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:21.590
Maria Minina (she/her): Clothing.

264
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.891
Taylor Macdonald: I'll I'll put the buttons and elastics.

265
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.843
Maria Minina (she/her): Yes, and we need all the buttons and elastics, and all the dresses, all the pants.

266
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.689
Taylor Macdonald: A built-in belt.

267
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:33.430
Maria Minina (she/her): That'll be the the key about your your fashion line.

268
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.490
Taylor Macdonald: Yes.

269
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.420
Maria Minina (she/her): Oh, that's cool.

270
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:48.910
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, I'm like you're doing. I was. I was gonna flip that into. How can we use that as motivation for recovery. But right now I think you you're motivated. So we don't need to like flip it like that.

271
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.810
Maria Minina (she/her): But okay.

272
00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.999
Maria Minina (she/her): what else is going on? Taylor.

273
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.239
Taylor Macdonald: Nothing. Really. I just been

274
00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:13.970
Taylor Macdonald: trying to figure out different things that like I might need to be doing like mostly just with, like the portions and stuff. Now that we do have the meal plan, because I've been trying to think like we've been looking back and like when we try to do like something different, like, instead of like the same thing every night we try to look for like

275
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:41.499
Taylor Macdonald: well, these are just examples that they give us, but we were looking last night for something, and we were looking on the list. They're like, wait. They didn't even put this on the list, so like. Should I be eating it or not? I think it was yesterday morning when we were making the breakfast. Burritos I'm like, I don't know necessarily if I want rice this morning in my burrito. Can I do like sweet potatoes instead? And we did that, but we were looking on the list, and we're like sweet, like. Potatoes aren't even on here, but I'm pretty sure they're a starch.

276
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.440
Taylor Macdonald: I think it should be okay.

277
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:49.279
Maria Minina (she/her): I I'm like, I think so, but definitely ask ask Gabby tomorrow.

278
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.539
Maria Minina (she/her): but I mean, it's.

279
00:23:52.810 --> 00:24:02.089
Maria Minina (she/her): you know, some another thing with like burritos and stuff like that's a combination meal. So a lot of that stuff is also doubling. As like you say, quinoa is also protein.

280
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.769
Maria Minina (she/her): So there's a way to to switch it up.

281
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.370
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, yeah.

282
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:28.139
Taylor Macdonald: And I also thought about, because when I had the burrito I had like a cassava flour tortilla. So I looked it up because I was curious. I'm like, what is consava like considered. And I'm all like, Oh, it's actually it's a starchy root. So that also counts for another starch, I guess so I could do that, and I could put potatoes, and it would probably be

283
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.739
Taylor Macdonald: counting for like if I had like a cup of rice.

284
00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.000
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, you have such a cool palate. I love all the stuff that you're willing to eat.

285
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.439
Maria Minina (she/her): Have you been having any sort of like

286
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.049
Maria Minina (she/her): feelings about exercise.

287
00:24:46.170 --> 00:25:10.239
Taylor Macdonald: Miss it, cause I was thinking about it yesterday, and I like sometimes like today, I did it, and yesterday I did it like, I'll get up and I'll just stretch for like a couple of minutes, like I'll touch my toes like twist and stretch my arms and stuff. And that's almost like, okay, that's probably good enough, because I don't want to like accidentally, do something that's gonna like speed up my metabolism again, because I don't personally know how fast it's going right now, because I'm not a doctor.

288
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.110
Taylor Macdonald: But I do miss it, cause it kind of just gave me something to do.

289
00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.230
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

290
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.209
Maria Minina (she/her): Do you think about it a lot.

291
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:30.419
Taylor Macdonald: Not a lot, but it's it's if it's not like really like a thought. If I think about it a lot like I need to be exercising. I need to be doing this because I'm eating so much more. It's

292
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:49.130
Taylor Macdonald: I just miss it because I liked doing it, and it like it was part of like my daily thing. I just like I would get up. I would like eat breakfast, and then I'd exercise. I'd do my homework, and then I'd go on with the rest of my day. So it was kind of like it gave me like a little bit more like it would fill in the space of the day.

293
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.870
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

294
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:55.930
Maria Minina (she/her): no. And it's it stinks that. Yeah. The eating disorder twisted it because it was something that was

295
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.540
Maria Minina (she/her): good and enjoyable.

296
00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.770
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, okay.

297
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:15.239
Maria Minina (she/her): I'm gonna ask you, have you found yourself like trying to stand more, though, or do any sort of other stuff to kind of make up for the fact that you can't move as much.

298
00:26:16.415 --> 00:26:24.299
Taylor Macdonald: I probably I probably have been standing a lot more because when we were working in our family's haunted house like.

299
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.129
Maria Minina (she/her): Oh, well, that's.

300
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.710
Taylor Macdonald: Share.

301
00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:43.260
Taylor Macdonald: There was a chair right there, but like I'd be working for like I don't know, like 3, 4 h, and I was standing for like 3 to 4 h at a time, like I was not sitting down very much like, unless I was like I brought like a bag of walnuts, and I was like sitting down, and I was like taking off my gloves because my hands were cold, and

302
00:26:43.260 --> 00:27:00.760
Taylor Macdonald: so I was taking them off putting them on the seat and then eating my walnuts. And I'd be like, Okay, I'm gonna get back up again. But the way that I was working. I had to be like up. So I could like look through all like the little like peepholes and stuff to see when people were coming. So I'm like, Okay, I guess I'm just not gonna sit down because I don't feel like going up and down, up and down, up and down.

303
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.240
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

304
00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.335
Taylor Macdonald: Getting comfy, getting up.

305
00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.270
Maria Minina (she/her): What about after meals? What do you usually do?

306
00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.570
Taylor Macdonald: Thanks.

307
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:16.279
Taylor Macdonald: I might end up standing for a minute, but usually I just kind of like sit down, relax, because sometimes I'm like, oh, that was a lot.

308
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:27.799
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, that's good. Okay? I'm I'm gonna put that on. I'm asking. I'm not saying it's a behavior. It's something that you're doing. But I'm just gonna put it on Mom's radar because it could just start impulsively happening

309
00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:28.514
Maria Minina (she/her): that

310
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.409
Maria Minina (she/her): we do sometimes see that when

311
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:45.889
Maria Minina (she/her): we have to have exercise restriction. And our bodies do start changing that like teens will start standing more or like, yeah, you just see them standing in the living room after a meal, or like taking the long way through the house.

312
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:46.520
Taylor Macdonald: So.

313
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:52.980
Maria Minina (she/her): And it just being mindful about little things like that of more. So of like, is this becoming a pattern?

314
00:27:53.420 --> 00:28:00.719
Maria Minina (she/her): Are are we maybe subconsciously, or maybe a little bit consciously, trying to burn a few extra calories in some way.

315
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:01.800
Taylor Macdonald: Okay.

316
00:28:02.086 --> 00:28:04.663
Maria Minina (she/her): Not saying you're doing that, Taylor, but it's just.

317
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:19.520
Taylor Macdonald: That taking the long way around the house with like, if we if I was in like our trailer, or something, I'd definitely probably like end up being like instead of like going this way, I'd probably go around like probably not even like thinking about it. I'd probably be like, I'm just gonna go this way.

318
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.950
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, yeah, sometimes it's just a a weird, a feeling we have. And we follow it.

319
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:37.740
Maria Minina (she/her): you know. Especially, because, like you are, you're in. You're in week 4 right now. I kind of think of it as more of like week 3. Because of how the intakes are staggered.

320
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:51.310
Maria Minina (she/her): And it's it's really cool to see how how motivated you are. And sometimes without, like the 6 7 week mark, we do start just seeing people get a little tired and burned out.

321
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.550
Maria Minina (she/her): And so

322
00:28:54.350 --> 00:29:07.610
Maria Minina (she/her): I'm just saying that now, so that if you do at some point realize, like man, I'm not feeling as motivated or like. This is a little bit harder that you're able to hopefully talk to Mom about that. But, more importantly, like not

323
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:15.649
Maria Minina (she/her): be judgmental or like hard on yourself for it, like, why am I suddenly not motivated, or something?

324
00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.940
Maria Minina (she/her): because a lot of times

325
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.320
Maria Minina (she/her): at that point the eating disorder could feel a lot more cornered

326
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.190
Maria Minina (she/her): than it has in the past.

327
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.739
Maria Minina (she/her): and kind of starts like

328
00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.519
Maria Minina (she/her): lashing out on you.

329
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:30.810
Taylor Macdonald: Hmm.

330
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.139
Maria Minina (she/her): Yes. So something to just keep in mind.

331
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.190
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay, yeah.

332
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:42.279
Maria Minina (she/her): But it sounds like, so far, you haven't really noticed any. Your eating disorder getting much louder.

333
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:52.700
Taylor Macdonald: No, I haven't like noticed like if anything, I've probably noticed it less like more of like the like. Thinking about everything like.

334
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.110
Maria Minina (she/her): Thank you.

335
00:29:53.110 --> 00:30:04.409
Taylor Macdonald: So I I still think about it sometimes, or like I'll think about it a little bit. But like I'm not always like thinking about like, what is this? What am I eating right now? I don't know. Like it doesn't like

336
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.010
Taylor Macdonald: super super bug me anymore.

337
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.890
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

338
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:16.150
Taylor Macdonald: I think, because we have like this week and next week that we're here. But then we are the 2 weeks after that gonna be on the cruise. So that's gonna be

339
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.729
Taylor Macdonald: the next thing figuring out.

340
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:19.170
Maria Minina (she/her): Yes.

341
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.460
Taylor Macdonald: What kind of food they have at the buffets, and what kind of food. So we're gonna have to like

342
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:27.760
Taylor Macdonald: navigate that when we get on there and figure out what we can eat to.

343
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.380
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

344
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.060
Taylor Macdonald: This 2 weeks will be kind of

345
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:41.390
Taylor Macdonald: like, safe weeks. Kind of right, like, you know what we're eating. But then it's gonna be different for a couple of weeks. So that's getting into like the 6 and 7 weeks, too. We're gonna be kind of off for a couple of weeks and.

346
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:42.320
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

347
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.580
Taylor Macdonald: Seeing what we can.

348
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:51.320
Taylor Macdonald: Well, we're going to. We're going to Mexico. So I'm guessing they're probably gonna have Tacos. There's a Taco bar on the cruise ship.

349
00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.589
Maria Minina (she/her): Gonna have delicious food. That's for sure.

350
00:30:53.590 --> 00:31:07.079
Taylor Macdonald: And then I was like, there's probably brown rice at the buffet you can have like rice still, and veggies. I think that they did when we were on our other cruise, too, like 6 months ago, and they, I think they had like rices and stuff they had like a salad bar. But

351
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:16.279
Taylor Macdonald: I also, I still like, try to look out, because, like I'll think about it for a minute. I'm like, what is this made of like cause like I also try to think of like

352
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:34.720
Taylor Macdonald: that. Probably like even the eggs I'm like, they probably put like milk in those scrambled eggs like to make them more fluffy, or like they probably put like flour, or something in this like, or this is made of gluten or dairy, or something like that. So I like try to be cautious of that, because I'm like I don't know what's in it.

353
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.000
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

354
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.099
Maria Minina (she/her): And while on your cruise like that's

355
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:50.949
Maria Minina (she/her): keep an eye on that right about, am I? Yeah, am I more curious about flour and and dairy and gluten? Or am I starting to worry about other ingredients in the food as well.

356
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:59.440
Maria Minina (she/her): because I yeah, the the flour and and dairy I'm not as concerned about you worrying about, because that's your gut health.

357
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:06.559
Maria Minina (she/her): But yeah, if if you start thinking like, what oil or did they add any extra butter in this or things like that.

358
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.820
Maria Minina (she/her): those are the little red flags.

359
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.300
Maria Minina (she/her): And like

360
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:21.259
Maria Minina (she/her): I don't know how cruises work with like bringing your own like you bring. I'm thinking, if there's a day that's like really hard. Can we have stuff in our cabin.

361
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:30.510
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, you can bring snacks. And I actually saw this lady because it was our 1st cruise. The last one went on with my family, and she was actually down the elevator, and she had, like

362
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:39.819
Taylor Macdonald: a case or 2 of like an alternative milk that she had with her. Yeah, in her different foods. And I was like, Wow, like she was bringing a lot of stuff.

363
00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.210
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay.

364
00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:46.089
Taylor Macdonald: She was like, Oh, yeah, they always let me bring all this. And she was actually like on a cart taking an elevator. How much food she had brought.

365
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.010
Maria Minina (she/her): Dang, okay.

366
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:51.250
Taylor Macdonald: I think, she said, that she was like allergic to like Soy, or something like that

367
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.460
Taylor Macdonald: allergic, I think, to like gluten dairy and soy, so.

368
00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:54.949
Maria Minina (she/her): Oh! Damn!

369
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:55.590
Taylor Macdonald: Oh

370
00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:56.600
Taylor Macdonald: yes!

371
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.750
Maria Minina (she/her): Very limited, though.

372
00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:09.029
Taylor Macdonald: What's a boring? But we're driving this time and not flying. So I figured, too, that she could have, like her own bag with, you know different snacks that she likes.

373
00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:19.719
Maria Minina (she/her): Yes, that's what I was thinking of, like nutrient, dense stuff, so that if there is a meal that's like, Oh, the all these eggs are clearly made with milk, and all of that. Can I go and get just like.

374
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.390
Taylor Macdonald: We were able to find a special station last time that actually

375
00:33:23.772 --> 00:33:39.520
Taylor Macdonald: made eggs to order. So that was better, too, like over easy or whatever. Yeah. Oh, I didn't know. So there was one like, you have to look at the different restaurants. See what they have. But you just yeah, it's kind of a challenge if you have to be, you know, worried about it. But they do make yeah.

376
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:57.640
Taylor Macdonald: certain things different places. So yeah. And I I tell her all the time I'm like, I'm very grateful that I am not like deathly allergic to anything, because if I had to be like strictly, strictly like worried about everything. I would never stop thinking, because I'm like, at least, if I accidentally get it like, if it's a little bit, or if it's like

377
00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:04.410
Taylor Macdonald: in there, somehow, it's not. Gonna it's not gonna affect me so much as like if I'm eating like yogurt or something like that.

378
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:04.970
Maria Minina (she/her): Bye, bye.

379
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:10.650
Taylor Macdonald: Pure dairy, which would probably mess up my stomach. But

380
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:32.749
Taylor Macdonald: but until you are getting better with, we start eating like grass, fed butter, and she feels like she's better with that part of dairy. So yeah, I was, I was adding in different things, yeah, adding, in like the grass fed dairy has not seemed to bug me as much, and I kind of like thought about it for a minute. I'm like, why does it seem like the regular dairy like bugs me more than this, and

381
00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:37.460
Taylor Macdonald: I was researching it. And it says that, like, Non, I researched it again.

382
00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:40.399
Maria Minina (she/her): I smile when you say research, but I appreciate it.

383
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:53.249
Taylor Macdonald: Because I was just researching. I'm all like, why do I feel like it's like bugging me more than like the grass fed and like the ones that are 100% grass fed is, that's all they're getting. They're all just getting grass, that's it. And

384
00:34:54.679 --> 00:35:09.839
Taylor Macdonald: yes, they're not getting green grains. And the ones that have not been grass fed, I guess, get fed like sometimes, like wheat or other things. So I'm like, maybe it's kind of just like the gluten, or something that like was affecting me, not so much like

385
00:35:09.919 --> 00:35:18.889
Taylor Macdonald: I mean, I was, I think, allergic to dairy when I was little, but like if I've outgrown it now, like maybe it was just like the gluten more now that kind of messes with my stomach.

386
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:29.179
Taylor Macdonald: probably because I haven't had it in so long like when I didn't eat it for a long time, and then tried it again. My stomach's like, I'm not used to this anymore. That is not that does not feel good.

387
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:29.840
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

388
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:39.349
Maria Minina (she/her): I'm not a chemist. But I think you might be onto something right if someone's eating something constantly, I imagine, like that's gonna come out in the milk production.

389
00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.350
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

390
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.450
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay.

391
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.490
Maria Minina (she/her): interesting. Well.

392
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.409
Maria Minina (she/her): glad you're still experimenting.

393
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.310
Maria Minina (she/her): I'm smiling now because I'm thinking about probably how much

394
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:54.690
Maria Minina (she/her): I'm gonna say, random knowledge that you have but good knowledge that you have

395
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:58.259
Maria Minina (she/her): and that you're developing around like nutrition and things like that.

396
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.890
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

397
00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:11.820
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, definitely, definitely, random knowledge. Like, if somebody like, if somebody asked me like, Oh, what like? I wonder what that cow is getting fed over there, I'd be like I have no idea. But I can tell you right now. It's probably not grass fed.

398
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.995
Maria Minina (she/her): And here's how I know.

399
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:16.990
Taylor Macdonald: It's so funny.

400
00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.090
Maria Minina (she/her): Got it. Oh, my gosh.

401
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.935
Maria Minina (she/her): Taylor, now that I know that I did forget that the cruise is coming up.

402
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:32.100
Maria Minina (she/her): Do you have any additional concern cause. I I agree, making sure we have the foods.

403
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.420
Maria Minina (she/her): Sorted out and planned ahead.

404
00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.859
Maria Minina (she/her): Do you have any additional concerns about just like

405
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.509
Maria Minina (she/her): I don't know. I don't know what you have concerns about.

406
00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:54.909
Taylor Macdonald: Well, I think like it does kind of get harder like when you have to like, be on a place, or be in a place that has like certain things like, and that's all they have, like they usually do have a lot of options like.

407
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:55.230
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

408
00:36:55.230 --> 00:37:11.630
Taylor Macdonald: Different diets and different people and stuff, and they'll try and do that like. So people have options. What I've noticed also is like they don't have like either, just like a gluten and dairy free like version, unless it's like a salad or something like that.

409
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:16.389
Taylor Macdonald: But like you either have to pick like gluten, free or vegan, like.

410
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:17.590
Maria Minina (she/her): Poison. Yeah.

411
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:22.169
Taylor Macdonald: Pick which one you're gonna have, because they most of the time don't do both.

412
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:22.910
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

413
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:41.159
Taylor Macdonald: But they do have a lot of options, and I guess my biggest concern would be like not being able to find something like that I need like. Oh, for lunch, like they're serving all this other stuff. But that does not sound good right now. I don't really feel like having that, or like

414
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:47.760
Taylor Macdonald: ending up like being like oh, nothing sounds good, and then not eating anything that would probably be.

415
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.710
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

416
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:53.950
Taylor Macdonald: Something I would be scared of doing. But I also know like I'm like I have to eat.

417
00:37:54.010 --> 00:38:05.039
Taylor Macdonald: so I guess I'll go eat like rice and veggies, or something like that, if I can find it. Well, there's other. There's like usually like this one, too, I think, because the Sushi restaurant. So there is

418
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:09.820
Taylor Macdonald: like that. And so I mean, that's still, you're getting your rice and your

419
00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.530
Taylor Macdonald: everything in it. But

420
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:42.130
Taylor Macdonald: yeah, so it's just gonna be. We should have to think about it. And yeah, and plan it out there. There was supposed to be on our last cruise. There was supposed to be a smoothie bar. But we got on the cruise, and we asked, like all the waiters we're like, Hey, we haven't seen the smoothie bar yet. Where is it. And they're like, Oh, that's on the next class up of the cruises. You have to get on a bigger cruise to get that. I'm like. It was advertised on this one. I've been looking forward to getting a smoothie since we got on this dang ship.

421
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.129
Taylor Macdonald: There was, though, like the the pizza restaurant, it's open like.

422
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:47.640
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

423
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:56.399
Taylor Macdonald: 3 Am. Because they did have a gluten free option, and you could get no cheese on it and just veggies whatever you want.

424
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:03.300
Taylor Macdonald: So she was always something kind of open. If she wanted to go get pizza.

425
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:09.800
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, and maybe having to tolerate eating food that you don't necessarily want in the moment

426
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.800
Maria Minina (she/her): sound the best. But it's still.

427
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:22.664
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah, do do I want to choose what sounds good? Or do I want to choose what's gonna make me feel good because we are trapped on this boat for like another week, so I don't really feel like being sick.

428
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:29.180
Maria Minina (she/her): Exactly. Yeah. And maybe that's exactly of the way you're gonna be making decisions of, like.

429
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:38.460
Maria Minina (she/her): right? You need to make a recovery focused decision. It's do I just completely skip this meal, or do I maybe eat something? That's not my preference, but it's fine.

430
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.640
Maria Minina (she/her): And then I have energy for the rest of the day.

431
00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.580
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

432
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.365
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

433
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:54.660
Maria Minina (she/her): see, I think it'll be interesting to. I'm going to be so curious to hear your your feedback on, just like how your brain processed, everything going on around you.

434
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.310
Maria Minina (she/her): So.

435
00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:57.550
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

436
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.940
Taylor Macdonald: at least you've done it once, right? Yeah, at least, I've done it once.

437
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.169
Maria Minina (she/her): Know what to expect.

438
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.060
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

439
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:21.530
Taylor Macdonald: a little bit. Yeah. They. They have, like certain restaurants that like close for a certain period of time. And then they reback like open up or something. But I wonder if there's like any different restaurants on this one? Since we're going to a different place. It is. There's Johnny rockets that the last one didn't have.

440
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:22.830
Maria Minina (she/her): Oh, that's fun!

441
00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:40.930
Taylor Macdonald: For, like the milkshakes, I know you won't eat them, but Sean probably will. So the the drink pass works for milkshakes there. So there is, there's different. And then the Taco shop is like the hot dog place the other one probably had. Remember fish and chips. Yeah. So this one has Tacos. I'll be spending my time there.

442
00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.080
Maria Minina (she/her): Do you like Mexican food?

443
00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.760
Taylor Macdonald: I do. That's like our safest thing not having to get like Gluten Dairy. So I

444
00:40:46.780 --> 00:41:02.840
Taylor Macdonald: because unless you get like, unless you get like nachos or something. Then it's probably gonna have like cheese or something on it. But most of the time it's just like corn tortillas, carne asada onions and cilantro. That's it. And your avocado, yeah. And like, if you want guacamole, you can have it. But it's mostly.

445
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:10.300
Maria Minina (she/her): I can see you enjoying being able to look down on a burrito and see all the ingredients I feel like that gives you a sense of safety.

446
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.055
Taylor Macdonald: Yes.

447
00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:16.290
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, cause I remember last week you about, I think, Chili, or something you're like. I don't know what's in it.

448
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:22.099
Taylor Macdonald: Oh, my cousin, yeah. Yeah. Well, cause I also think about like, sometimes I'm all like.

449
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:36.288
Taylor Macdonald: this isn't like the same person. This person does not make the food the same way we do. And I know we make our food like differently, because we have to like avoid certain things sometimes. So I'm like, I don't know like what type of like

450
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:45.440
Taylor Macdonald: stuff they're putting in there so like they might put like flour in their chili to make it like thicker or something like that. So I kind of like, think about that. I'm all like

451
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:58.210
Taylor Macdonald: they might add extra things that I wouldn't normally add. So I kinda like, think about that aspect of like, they might do things differently. And it might be like something I don't even think about normally like that would be in there.

452
00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:58.770
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

453
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:08.609
Maria Minina (she/her): that is the case I have noticed with like, dairy or eggs or flour. Yeah, it's it's in stuff where I'm like, why is, does this have to be here like.

454
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:09.430
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

455
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:10.320
Maria Minina (she/her): But.

456
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:29.660
Taylor Macdonald: Like all the gluten free breads like I'm I was asking my mom I'm like, is that why, vegans and stuff like mostly eat like they still eat like bread and stuff because it doesn't have eggs. And she's like, yeah, because, like bread normally doesn't have eggs. But all the gluten. Free breads like don't have like the yeast most of the time to like rise, so they use eggs so like.

457
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.130
Maria Minina (she/her): And.

458
00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.009
Taylor Macdonald: Combines all together.

459
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:33.039
Maria Minina (she/her): To help it, stick.

460
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.630
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah.

461
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:43.420
Maria Minina (she/her): I have some nutritional knowledge, but you're definitely outpacing me. I will say that.

462
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:50.580
Taylor Macdonald: Before all this. I think I told you, too, because she'll look up everything. And I was like, well, maybe later on, you're gonna get like, you're gonna be a dietician.

463
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:58.540
Taylor Macdonald: It's because she likes. She just researches everything like more than I do. And I'm like, Okay, Taylor. But yeah. And then this all.

464
00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:05.310
Maria Minina (she/her): It's a cool job. They're they're figuring out what the body needs and like how to how to make that work. And it's it's

465
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.889
Maria Minina (she/her): they do, they work wonders. I appreciate that.

466
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:08.860
Taylor Macdonald: Yes.

467
00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:19.019
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, and it's 1 of those things where you get into it. I don't know if it's this way anymore. But like in California. Only a certain amount of people can test every year. So.

468
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.770
Taylor Macdonald: Oh, really.

469
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.870
Maria Minina (she/her): Or if, yeah, people who can become registered dietitians.

470
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:23.740
Taylor Macdonald: Oh, wow!

471
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.280
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah. So

472
00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:30.868
Maria Minina (she/her): I think there's limited programs in California. But yeah, so it's it's a cool thing.

473
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:38.260
Maria Minina (she/her): we've got a few minutes left. I want to see if there's anything you guys want to bring up that I didn't bring up.

474
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:39.950
Taylor Macdonald: Don't

475
00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.119
Taylor Macdonald: think so. Really.

476
00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.737
Taylor Macdonald: I was. Kinda I was kind of just curious, like,

477
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:51.530
Taylor Macdonald: Do you think like I'd be able to meet the dietician sooner, or do you think it's probably gonna still be a while.

478
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.390
Maria Minina (she/her): Well.

479
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.729
Maria Minina (she/her): I am looking at your calendar. Honestly.

480
00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.219
Maria Minina (she/her): I would say.

481
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.659
Maria Minina (she/her): are you meeting with the you're meeting the dietitian tomorrow? Mom?

482
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:09.572
Taylor Macdonald: And I just I guess she didn't have any of our growth charts or anything.

483
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.260
Maria Minina (she/her): Yes.

484
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:21.389
Taylor Macdonald: I was asking about that. So right after I got off the computer with her last week, I was able. We went into Taylor's phone found them all. So I think she might have more information from all the stuff I was able to get to her.

485
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:37.689
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, okay, yeah. So if that's the case, if if she got growth charts and stuff that means this week Gabby's gonna talk to your mom about any like goal weight or things like that, where you should be on the growth curve. So I think maybe let's leave that conversation to them.

486
00:44:38.126 --> 00:44:48.783
Maria Minina (she/her): But I think, mom, yeah, ask tomorrow. Talk to Gabby about maybe starting to include Taylor more often, maybe not every week, but

487
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.660
Maria Minina (she/her): more often. And then.

488
00:44:52.030 --> 00:45:06.930
Maria Minina (she/her): just to remind you, you guys both do have a family and a peer mentor. So they're also just really great resources for right peer mentors been through this, and then. You have, Lisa. She had a daughter in eating disorder treatment also as a teenager. So

489
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:11.579
Maria Minina (she/her): just provide extra support and guidance. So yes.

490
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:17.699
Maria Minina (she/her): I can't give the answer about the dietician. But, mom, I'm cool with not following up. Yeah.

491
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.204
Taylor Macdonald: Maybe she'll let you do it next week before we go on the cruise or something. Okay.

492
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.190
Maria Minina (she/her): Would be cool, too, because next week I will want to

493
00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:31.360
Maria Minina (she/her): kind of. I want to hear your plan for the cruise next week, and how you're gonna what your game plan is. Okay.

494
00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:31.920
Taylor Macdonald: Okay.

495
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.089
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay? And then

496
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:38.510
Maria Minina (she/her): yeah, maybe that would be cool if you could see Gabby before then, so she could give you some ideas, too.

497
00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.750
Maria Minina (she/her): So cool.

498
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:46.810
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah. And I don't think, do we have a microwave in the cruise? No, we don't have a microwave

499
00:45:47.230 --> 00:46:00.530
Taylor Macdonald: we have. We had like we went to the store when we were in our trailer like, because we don't use stove in there. So we got like little microwave packets of rice, and like we could bring those, and like microwave, or something like, I found the quinoa

500
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:06.040
Taylor Macdonald: particular quinoa in the little microwave packet. So I'm like here. You can have this while we're traveling.

501
00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:06.820
Maria Minina (she/her): Cool.

502
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.340
Taylor Macdonald: So.

503
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.779
Maria Minina (she/her): Yeah, yeah, maybe not that. But there's other ideas.

504
00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:12.670
Taylor Macdonald: Yeah.

505
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.560
Maria Minina (she/her): Okay.

506
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:14.790
Maria Minina (she/her): yeah.

507
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:21.499
Maria Minina (she/her): And you know, you can always write a list of your questions for Mom to ask Gabby. So.

508
00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:31.370
Taylor Macdonald: I ask her sometimes I'm like, can you ask her about this one thing? I asked her once, I'm like, can you ask her about chia seeds, and she asked her, and I got the answer back. So I'm like, Okay.

509
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:34.999
Maria Minina (she/her): Beautiful, and Mom follows through. It's a it's a good good team.
